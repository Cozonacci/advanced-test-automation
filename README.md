# Advanced Test Automation Practices workshop

In each exercise, you will experiment with one aspect or technique of advanced test automation using Cucumber and Serenity BDD.
You will first see a working scenario which illustrates the approach. 
Then you will need to implement another similar scenario to put the approach into practice. 
The tutorial will guide you through one possible solution, though there are others.

There are two variations of the tutorial:
  * Lean Page Objects and Action Classes [check out the _action_classes-start_ branch](https://github.com/serenity-dojo/advanced-test-automation/tree/action-classes-start)
  * The Screenplay Pattern [check out the _screenplay-start_ branch](https://github.com/serenity-dojo/advanced-test-automation/tree/screenplay-start)
